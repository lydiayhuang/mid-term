6. What is a higher order function? What is a callback?

In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function (also functional, functional form or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e., procedural parameters), returns a function as its result.

A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function (let's call this other function “otherFunction”) as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the otherFunction
